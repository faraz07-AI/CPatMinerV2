# Leap Paint

Leap-enabled VR painting, and various VR application utilities we've built up in an AppModules directory. We do not provide official support for this repository but present it as-is to the community to reference building applications with Leap Motion.

Also be sure to check out our [Unity Modules][unitymodules], which is the backbone of this application and Leap Motion support for Unity!
