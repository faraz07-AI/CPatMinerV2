    /// A Panel that supports binding an Enum property on an arbitrary object to a set of RadioButton controls.

    /// USAGE: Add any number of RadioButtons. Assign the numeric value of your Enum's corresponding option to the Tag property of each button. (E.g., 
    /// if MyEnum.Foo 0, MyEnum.Bar = 1, then radioButton1.Text = "Foo", radioButton1.Tag = 0, radioButton2.Text = "Bar", RadioButton2.tag = 1, and so

    /// user selects another option.
