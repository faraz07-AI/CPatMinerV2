The options screen was rewritten for 2.0.3 and as a part of that I wanted
to use data binding. Unfortunately after having rewritten the screen
(twice) I discovered that Mono's support for data binding is not complete.
This is especially true of older versions of Mono.

The classes here are part of the workaround for the lack of data binding
in Mono. They are pretty basic and not heavily automated in the same way
that .NET's data binding is - I didn't need a reimplementation of data
binding, just something that would cover my use cases and be reasonably
easy to debug.

Binding is managed by a class based on ControlBinder. ControlBinder takes
care of hooking and unhooking the model and the control, and of copying
values between model and control. It is abstract.

For simple "one model property <-> one control property" cases there are
a bunch of binders, all based on ValueBinder. ValueBinder assumes that
the model implements INotifyPropertyChanged. The binders based on it are:
    CheckBoxBoolBinder
    FileNameStringBinder
    FolderStringBinder
    LabelStringBinder
    NumericIntBinder
    NumericDoubleBinder
    TextBoxStringBinder

For "one model property <-> one value from a list of value" property cases
there is a ValueFromListBinder, from which a bunch of control binder derive:
    ComboBoxBinder          <-- list can be anything, defaults to simple value
    ComboBoxValueBinder     <-- list contains simple values; ints, strings etc.
    ComboBoxEnumBinder      <-- list built automatically from enum values
